# Introduction
This R package was created in the first place to calculate more quickly and easily a lot of formulas related to popular probability distributions, such as : 

- Uniform 
- Binomial
- Exponential
- Gamma
- 


# Formulas available
I've tried to make the package pretty simple : 

## Mean
if you want to get the mean of a specific function, you just have to enter  `E_*<name of the distribution>`. For example, you can calculate the mean for a $Gamma(\alpha, \beta)$ distribution with `E_gamma(alph, beta)`.
