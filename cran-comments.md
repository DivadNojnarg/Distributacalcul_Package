## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

+   Changed all 'F' and 'T' to 'FALSE' and 'TRUE'.
+   Removed \dontrun{} from the TVaR_BNCOMP example.
+   Added @return field to function documentation to describe what each functions returns.
+   Removed the notes on Distributacalcul_vis module functions and replaced with @return field describing their use.
